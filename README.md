# Fundamentals-of-Statistics-and-Visualization-in-Python [Video]
This is the code repository for [Fundamentals-of-Statistics-and-Visualization-in-Python [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/data/fundamentals-of-statistics-and-visualization-in-python-video), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Statistics and visualization in Python can be applied to a wide variety of areas; having these skills is crucial for data scientists. In this course, we explore several core statistical concepts to utilize data; construct confidence intervals in Python and assess the results; discover correlations; and update your beliefs using Bayesian Inference.
In this tutorial, you will discover how to use the Statsmodels, Matplotlib, Pandas, and Seaborn Python libraries for statistical data visualization. Follow along with author—Dr Karen Yang, a seasoned data scientist and data engineer—to explore, learn, and strengthen your skills in fundamental statistics and visualization. This course utilizes the Jupyter Notebook environment to execute tasks.
By the end of this learning journey, you'll have developed a solid understanding of fundamental statistics and visualization concepts and will be confident enough to apply them to your data analysis projects.
