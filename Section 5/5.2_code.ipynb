    "In general, hypothesis testing provides evidence about the plausibility of a hypothesis, given the data.  With statistical (frequentist) inference, there is a population parameter that is unknowable. You will collect data and come up with a sample parameter (coefficent estimate), say a mean, that is used as a proxy for the population parameter, given a normal distribution. What you are doing is estimating the best parameter as you can with your sample data.  Frequentist view probability as a long-run limiting frequency. \n",

In other words, the probability of getting a positive mammogram just by random chance, if the woman does not have cancer is 9.6%."
